# Homework 03 JavaScript Password Generator Demo

> A simpler javascript password generator styled with bootstrap.

This is a class exercise in learning javascript and part of a full stack flex bootcamp. This implementation is based on class requirements and a tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sT03jEwcaw. Thw UI looks similar but is a bootstrap implementation. It does meet the specified acceptance criteria.

Here's how it differs

- This implementation uses bootstrap instead of a float grid system.
  - We're learning bootstrap, practice it on every possible occasion.
- Input is restricted on the frontend to valid values with default, rather than being checked in javascript.
- All input is gathered on the page versus prompts and alerts.
